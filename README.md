# Network-Management

Exercise on Network Management course - Departement of Informatics and Telecommunications, National & Kapodistrian Uneversity of Athens.

This simulation took place at Ubuntu VirtualBox using python 2.7. The goal of this project is to recreate the given experiments as presented at the papers below:
- From Theory to Experimental Evaluation: Resource Management in Software- Defined Vehicular Networks, Ramon Fontes, Christian Esteve Rothenberg et. al.
- Mininet-WiFi: A Platform for Hybrid Physical-Virtual Software-Defined Wireless Networking Research, Ramon Fontes, Christian Esteve Rothenberg.

We experimented with different scenarios and we calculated the throughput, jitter, packet loss and latency for each case.

# Experiment 1

Experiment on resilient resource aggregating mechanisms in a SDN-based VANET scenario, where the SDN/OpenFlow controller is responsible for managing all emulated nodes.

The report of the exercise, where the measurements of throughput, jitter, packet loss and latency for every subcase is presented and fully explained, is also uploaded on the repository in Greek.
